# BLT - Better Latency Tester
The Better Latency Tester (BLT) is an end to end latency measuring device that measures system latency from input to photon.

BLT features include:
- Automatic or manual threshhold calibration
- Run batched, self-triggered tests via USB mouse HID inputs, with latency logging.
- Microphone triggered tests for testing mouse latency.

> Inspired by the NVIDIA LDAT. This project is independent and unaffiliated with NVIDIA.
